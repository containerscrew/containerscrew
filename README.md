I want to try to publish content once a week, both in this github repository and in the website I want to set up under https://containerscrew.com. I also have some repositories to publish that I'm working on, I just need time :)

`Many people/companies save time on technology solutions thanks to open source. Everyone wants open source, but very few people/companies invest time in sharing. Open source is not a way to make a living, you can't live on handouts (I think). But it doesn't cost anything to give a little back to the community with solutions that can help everyone's day to day life.`
